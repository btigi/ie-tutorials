# Immortal Invisible Creatures

There are times in IE modding when you need a script to be run, or need access to scripting commands or triggers, and a script is not available.  
In these situations, the most common workaround is to summon an invisible, immortal creature who runs the script in question, and which then destroys itself.  
In most situations, the specifics of the creature are irrelevant, as it only exists for a few seconds. However, in some conditions, the creature may be around for a while, and it's important to know that it won't affect gameplay in any way.  
The creature provided here satisfies these conditions and has the following attributes:

## States
- `state_nondetection`
- `state_improvedinvisibility`

## Effects
- Invisibility  
- Transparency Fade  
- Protection from Creature Type (All creature types)  
- Protection from Spells Levels (Levels 1-9)  
- No Morale Failure  
- Protection from weapons (All weapons)  
- Movement modifier (No movement)  
- Minimum HP  
- Avatar Removal  
- Selection Circle Removal  
- Protection from Attribute Drain (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Charisma)  
- Protection from Display String  

## Other
- No name  
- No corpse  
- Squirrel animation (small)  
- Damage resistances set to 100  

Feel free to use it as a base, rather than create your own.  
**NB:** The creature has no death variable - you should set one before you use it.
